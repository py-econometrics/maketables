# Supported Model Classes

`maketables` supports creating regression tables for models from currently the following packages: 

- [PyFixest](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest)
- [statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels)
- [linearmodels](https://github.com/bashtage/linearmodels)
- [Stata](https://www.stata.com/python/pystata19/) via [PyStata](docs\pystataIntegration.ipynb)

maketables may also support other model classes that follow similar conventions. See [Adding Methods](AddingMethods.ipynb) for how to extend support to additional model types.
