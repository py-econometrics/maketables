title: "MakeTables"

---

A Python package for creating publication-ready tables from regression results (statsmodels, pyfixest, linearmodels), descriptive statistics, and balance tables with output to LaTeX, Word, and HTML via Great Tables.

## Overview

MakeTables provides a unified interface for generating tables such as:

- Regression tables from [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), [PyFixest](https://py-econometrics.github.io/pyfixest/pyfixest.html), [Linearmodels](https://bashtage.github.io/linearmodels/) and [Stata](https://www.stata.com/python/pystata19/)
- Descriptive statistics 
- Balance tables

The package supports multiple output formats including:

- Great Tables (HTML)
- LaTeX
- Microsoft Word (docx) documents
- Typst

## Development Status
MakeTables is in early stage development. Bug reports through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dsliwka/maketables/issues) are highly welcome.
:::

## Origin

MakeTables originated as the table output functionality within the [PyFixest](https://github.com/py-econometrics/pyfixest) package and has been moved to this standalone package to provide broader table creation capabilities and support other statistical packages.

## Installation

### From PyPI 
```bash
pip install maketables
```

### Development Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dsliwka/maketables.git
cd maketables
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Example

```{python}
#| eval: false
import pandas as pd
import maketables as mt
import pyfixest as pf

# Load your data (here using a sample Stata dataset with the import_dta function that also stores variable labels)
df = mt.import_dta("https://www.stata-press.com/data/r18/auto.dta")

# Create descriptive statistics table
mt.DTable(df, vars=["mpg","weight","length"], bycol=["foreign"])

# Fit your models (here using pyfixest)
est1 = pf.feols("mpg ~ weight", data=df)
est2 = pf.feols("mpg ~ weight + length", data=df)

# Make a regression table
mt.ETable([est1, est2])
```
